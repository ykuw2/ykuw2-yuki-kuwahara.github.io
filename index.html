    <p class="paragraph">
      Hey! My name is Yuki Kuwahara and I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley
      majoring in Data Science. I was born in Japan, but grew up in Southern
      California, specifically in the city of Irvine. I recieved my High School
      Diploma with the Seal of Biliteracy (in Japanese) from University High
      School. I am an avid tennis player, as I formerly played competitively in
      junior tournaments, and now as a member of California Club Tennis, one of
      the top university club tennis teams in the nation.

      <br />
      <br />

      My Data Science journey started quite differently than others. I initially
      attended to University of California, Irvine, pursuing a major in
      Mathematics. However because of the pandemic, I started to learn Python on
      my own, which peaked my interest into the world of Data Science. I then
      took a class called Math 10 (Introduction to Python Programming for Data
      Science) there, which made me want to pursue studying Data Science solely,
      deciding me to transfer to UC Berkeley. I don't regret this decision
      rather, I am glad that I made this decision as I learned many knowledge
      and skills of Data Science that I would have never imagined of.

      <br />
      <br />

      Recently, I've been interning at SwingVision, a start-up company bringing
      AI to tennis, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently in school, I am
      taking few classes with the notable ones being Ind Eng 142A (Introduction
      to Machine Learning and Data Analytics) and Info 159 (Natural Language
      Processing), both of which I am highly interested in and am excited to
      learn about.

      <br />
      <br />

      And in the future, I hope to work in the tech world as a Data Analyst or
      Data Scientist!
